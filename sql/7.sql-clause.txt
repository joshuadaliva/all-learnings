A. DISTINT - GET UNIQUE VALUES
    -   SELECT DISTINCT contact_name FROM customers;

B. WHERE 
    -   SELECT * FROM customer_name WHERE id = 1;
    -   SELECT * FROM customer_name WHERE customer_name in ("person");
    -   SELECT * FROM customer_name WHERE customer_name in (select customer_name from customers);

C. ORDER BY - SORT ROWS
    - 	SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY customer_name ASC/DESC;

D. GROUP BY  - group rows by COLUMN (USUALLY COMBINED WITH AGGREGATE FUNCTION)
    - it select the unique customer_name then it counts the total customer_name then it will show into that row


    sample table for group by:
    ===============
    name    country
    alice   usa
    bob     usa
    carol   canada
    dave    canada
    ==============
    -   select country , count(country) as country_count from travel group by country;
    
    ===result=====
    country    country_count
    usa        2
    canada     2

    -group by returns unique column then counts all values with the same value




E. HAVING - FILTER GROUPS AFTER GROUP BY
    - SELECT contact_name, count(contact_name) as all_contact from customers GROUP by contact_name having age > 17;
