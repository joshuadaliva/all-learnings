A. PRIMARY KEY
    - Is a column that uniquely identifies each row
    - must be unique and not null
    - one primary KEY
    -parent table

    create table users(
	    user_id int primary key AUTO_INCREMENT
    );


b. FOREIGN KEY 
    - is a column in one table that references the primary key of another table 
    - ensures that a value in the child
    - child table
    
    
    create table students(
        student_id int primary key AUTO_INCREMENT,
        student_name varchar(50) not null 
    )

    create table enrollments(
        enrollment_id int primary key AUTO_INCREMENT,
        student_id int not null,
        FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id)
    )

C. FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINT
    - on DELETE CASCADE - deletes child row automatically / deleting a student deletes enrollment
    - on DELETE SET NULL - set to null / tab;e remain but lose dept info
    - on DELETE RESTRICT - prevents delete if children exist

    example:
        - parent column is deleted now the child table using the fk to parent will also be deleted
