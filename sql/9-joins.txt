-rull of thumb - starts from what you need, like from employees





A. INNER FUNCTION  - returns only row where there are matching value in both tables
    scenario - find employees who are assigned to an existing department

    SELECT e.name, d.name from employees e
    INNER JOIN department d
    USING (dept_id);


B. LEFT JOIN - return all rows from the left table (employees) matching rows from the right table if not match, null is returned to right table
    scenario - show all employees and their department names if available
    
    SELECT e.name , d.name from employees e 
    LEFT JOIN department d
    USING (dept_id);


C. RIGHT JOIN - return all rows from the RIGHT table (department) matching rows from the lef table if not match, null is returned to lef table
    scenario - show all departments and their employyes names if available
    
    SELECT e.name , d.name from employees e 
    RIGHT JOIN department d
    USING (dept_id)
    where name = "";
    ;


D. FULL OUTER JOIN - returns all rows from both table
    scenario - show all employees and all departments even if no matching value

    NOT SUPPORTED IN MYSQL WE OFTEN USE UNION


E. CROSS JOIN - returns the cartesian product -> every row from one table combined
    scenario - generate all possible combination of employees and department

    SELECT e.name , d.name from employees e CROSS JOIN department d
